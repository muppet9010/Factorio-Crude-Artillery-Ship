# Factorio-Crude-Artillery-Ship
A very crude artillery ship added to a fork of the Cargo Ship mod.


Overview
--------

Made for a playthrough by JD-Plays as a simple and crude artillery ship.

There are no plans to update this mod and it is provided entirely as-is.

Based on a fork of the Cargo Ships mod, version 0.1.18. So it will remain locked to this Cargo Ships mod version.

For details on the great Cargo Ship mod see: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/cargo-ships


Adding to a game
----------------

This mod is a replacement (not supplementary) mod for the Cargo Ships mod. This is as I have to modify parts of it and can't just add to it.
Check how to add this mod based on your current game state:

- If you are starting a new game you can just use this mod and its graphics mod in replacement of the base Cargo Ship mods.
- If adding this mod to an existing game that didn't have the cargo ship mod already you can just use this mod and its graphics mod in replacement of the base Cargo Ship mods.
- If you are adding this mod to an existing game that DID have the cargo ship mod already; if you had used oil rigs or bridges then remove them from your game before swapping the mods out (untested but should work fine). If you hadn't used oil rigs or bridges then the mods can just be swapped out without issue.


Known Issues
-----------

- The graphics are a bit crude, only the main easily fixed things have/will be done. Accepted bad points:
    - The graphics of the artillery carriage on top of the ship can overlap slightly oddly in places.
    - The shadow of the cannon's barrel has been removed as I can't get it to align for the different rotations.
