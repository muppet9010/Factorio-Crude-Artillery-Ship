# Factorio-Crude-Artillery-Ship
A very crude artillery ship added to a fork of the Cargo Ship mod.


Made for a playthrough by JD-Plays as a simple and crude artillery ship. There are no plans to update this mod and it is provided entirely as-is.

Based on a fork of the Cargo Ships mod, version 0.1.18. As needed to modify some of its control files to add in support for the extra ship.
