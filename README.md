# Factorio-Crude-Artillery-Ship
A very crude artillery ship added to a fork of the Cargo Ship mod.


Made for a playthrough by JD-Plays as a simple and crude artillery ship. There are no plans to update this mod and it is provided entirely as-is.

Based on a fork of the Cargo Ships mod, version 0.1.18. As needed to modify some of its control files to add in support for the extra ship.

For details on the great Cargo Ship mod see: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/cargo-ships



Known Issus:

- The graphics are a bit crude, only the main easily fixed things have/will be done. Accepted bad points:
    - The flash when the artillery fires isn't at the end of the barrel.
    - The graphics of the artillery carriage on the ship can overlap slightly oddly in places.
